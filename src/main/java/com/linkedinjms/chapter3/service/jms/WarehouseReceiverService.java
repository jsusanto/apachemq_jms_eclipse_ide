/*
 * Java Spring Annotation
 * 
 * @Component is an annotation that allows Spring to automatically detect our custom beans.
 * In other words, without having to write any explicit code, Spring will:
 * - Scan our application for classes annotated with @Component
 * - Instantiate them and inject any specified dependencies into them
 * - Inject them wherever needed
 * 
 * Spring @Service annotation is used with classes that provide some business functionalities.
 * We mark beans with @Service to indicate that they're holding the business logic.
